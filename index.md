# Rubber Duck Auditing

The rubber duck auditing method is as follows:

1. Beg, borrow, steal, buy, fabricate or otherwise obtain a rubber duck (bathtub variety).
2. Place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that's all right.
3. Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line.
4. At some point you will tell the duck what security assumptions you're making next and then realise that those assumptions don't actually hold. The duck will sit there serenely, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you find a vulnerability.

**Note**: In a pinch a coworker might be able to substitute for the duck, however, it is often preferred to confide potential vulnerabilities to the duck instead of your coworker.

## FAQs

- **If ducks are so smart, why don't we just let the ducks do all the auditing?**
  It would be wonderful if this were true, but the fact is that most ducks prefer to take a mentoring role. There are a few ducks however that do choose to audit, but these are the ducks that nobody hears about because they are selected for secret government projects that are highly classified in nature.

- **Where can I learn more about rubber duck auditing?**
  More information about the rubber duck method can be found at [wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), [lists.ethernal.org](http://lists.ethernal.org/oldarchives/cantlug-0211/msg00174.html), [codinghorror.com](https://blog.codinghorror.com/rubber-duck-problem-solving/), and [zenhub.com](https://www.zenhub.com/blog/why-rubber-duck-debugging-is-the-best-way-to-debug-your-code/). The technique applies perfectly to security auditing.

- **Where can I hire my own duck?**
  Great question! [Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=rubber+duck) hosts a wide selection of affordable ducks that have graduated with a security degree from some of the world's leading universities.

- **Why does this site exist?**
  Inspired by the classic rubber duck debugging technique from [rubberduckdebugging.com](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/), this site adapts the method for security auditing. Explaining your code's security assumptions to a duck is one of the most effective ways to find vulnerabilities before attackers do.
